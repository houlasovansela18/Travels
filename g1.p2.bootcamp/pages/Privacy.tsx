						This Privacy Policy describes how our Company collects, uses, and
						shares information about you when you visit and interact on our
						website (mobile and desktop) and mobile app (collectively, Site) or
						other means connected to the Sites (such as contacting our customer
						service team via chat or email). Below is a summary of our privacy
						practices. Our full Privacy Policy is available below.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div className=" mt-6 text-sm">
					<p className=" font-semibold ">1. Information We Collect</p>
					<p>
						We may use your information to provide the requested services,
						maintain and improve the Site, and send you marketing
						communications.
					</p>
					<p>
						We collect information about you that you provide to us when using
						the Site, such as your name, address, phone number, credit card
						details, e-mail address, accommodation name, accommodation location
						and/or length of stay, and your Agoda account password for
						accommodation reservations. In addition for flight reservations, we
						may also collect passenger name, date of birth, nationality and
						passport details including passport number, country of issue and
						expiry date. By visiting our Site, we may also automatically collect
						certain usage information, such as your IP address, geographic data,
						country, search preferences related to specific searches, browser,
						and information about your operating system, application version,
						language settings, and pages that have been shown to you. If you are
						using a mobile device to access our mobile app or mobile optimized
						Site, we might also collect information that identifies your mobile
						device, such as the device ID, location of the device (with your
						consent), and device-specific settings and characteristics. If you
						participate in an Agoda program, there may be limited additional
						information that we may collect from the accommodation about your
						stay; for example, see the information below collected as part of
						the Agoda Umrah program. When you make a reservation, our system
						registers through which means and from which websites you have made
						your reservation. We may also collect certain information through
						cookies, tags, and similar technologies as detailed below. If you
						decide to book tours or other travel activities through our Site,
						depending on the type of tour or travel activity, there may be
						limited additional information that we may collect from you,
						including your passport details, date of birth, height and weight,
						pick-up location, your preferred tour/activity language, and
						information about any special requirements that we need to consider
						in connection with your participation in the respective
						tour/activity. If you need to get in touch with our customer support
						team, or reach out to us through other means (such as through social
						media, or communicating with your accommodation through us), we will
						collect information from you there too. Where you submit reviews
						regarding your accommodation or other ancillary services available
						on our website through us, we will collect information from you
						included in your reviews, including your first name and country of
						residence. You can decide to participate in our referral programs or
						other promotions, and doing this will also mean providing us with
						personal data. In addition to that, you can provide us with feedback
						or ask for help with using the Sites or our various communications
						platforms. Where you are making a booking with other guests whose
						details you provide to us as part of your reservation, or if you
						make a booking on behalf of someone else, it is your responsibility
						to ensure that the person or people you have provided personal
						information about are aware that you have done so, and have
						understood and accepted how Agoda uses their information (as
						described in this Privacy Policy). Accommodation partners may share
						information about you with us too – this may happen if you have
						questions about your pending booking or if disputes arise regarding
						your booking.

						2. How We Use the Information We Collect
					</p>
					<p>
						We may use your information to provide the requested services,
						maintain and improve the Site, and send you marketing
						communications.
					</p>
					<p>
						We may use information collected through the Site to: Provide you
						with the requested services, such as creating a user account,
						processing and confirming your reservation, and communicating with
						you about services requested (e.g., pre-reservation or post booking
						chat support (excluding credit card number), special request,
						cancellations, rewards Send you email marketing communications about
						products and services that may be relevant to you Conduct surveys or
						provide you with information about our services on our Site or on
						other websites you may visit Maintain and improve the Site, tailor
						the user experience, and for internal training Protect the security
						of you and the Site Exercising a right or obligation conferred or
						imposed by law, including responding to request and legal demands
						When you make a reservation on one of our business partners’
						websites or apps, we may also receive certain information such as
						your name and reservation information, including the accommodation
						reserved, in order to process your reservation and identify which
						channel your reservation has originated from. During calls with our
						customer support team, live listening may be done or calls may be
						recorded for quality and reference purposes which includes the usage
						of the recordings for the handling of claims, training and fraud
						detection purposes. If you would prefer that your call was not
						recorded, you can opt out by stating this, or by hanging up. Call
						recordings are kept for a limited amount of time and automatically
						deleted thereafter, unless Agoda has a legitimate interest to keep
						such recording for a longer period, including for fraud
						investigation and legal purposes. If you have not finalized a
						reservation online, we may send you up to two reminders to continue
						with your reservation. We believe that this additional service is
						useful to you because it allows you to carry on with a reservation
						without having to search for the accommodation again or fill in all
						the reservation details from scratch. These reminders are one-time
						only communications and reservation information used for such
						reminders will be deleted from our systems in accordance with our
						data retention policy detailed below. Please note that the
						confirmation emails and text messages sent after your booking are
						not marketing messages. These messages are part of your
						accommodation reservation process. Respectively, they contain
						information for you to check in at your booked accommodation and a
						separate invitation to complete the guest review form. You will
						continue to receive them, even if you have opted out of our
						marketing messages. Similarly, opting into receiving Price Alerts
						will not affect any other choices you have made regarding receiving
						communications from us. If you elect to receive Price Alerts, you
						will be able to opt out of receiving the same by clicking on the
						“turn off price alerts” or a similar message found in the Price
						Alert sent to you. If you have selected a Mix and Save offer but
						look to have only finalized part of the offer (e.g. only finalized
						the booking for one but not both rooms), we may send you an email
						confirming you selected Mix and Save and to remind you to complete
						all bookings for your selected Mix and Save offer. This message is
						part of the Mix and Save booking process confirming your selection
						and in case you have overlooked completing all bookings. In addition
						to this, we may also send you a pre-check in email reminding you
						about changing rooms during your stay at the accommodation. As
						mentioned above, if you are completing the booking for another
						person who will stay at the reserved accommodation, you also have
						the option to insert the guest’s email address for the purpose that
						the guest will receive the reservation confirmation and a separate
						invitation to complete a guest review. Communications on the Site We
						offer you and accommodation partners various means to communicate
						about accommodations and existing reservations, directing the
						communications through the Site. You can contact us with questions
						about your reservation or about your accommodation via the Site, and
						via other channels that we may make available. We may access
						communications and may use automated systems to review, scan, and
						analyze communications for security purposes; fraud prevention;
						compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; investigations of
						potential misconduct; product development and improvement; research;
						customer engagement, including to provide you with information and
						offers that we believe may be of interest to you; and customer or
						technical support. We reserve the right to block the delivery of or
						review communications that we, in our sole discretion, believe may
						contain malicious content, spam, or may pose a risk to you or,
						accommodation partners, us, or others. Note, all communications sent
						or received using the site communication tools will be received and
						stored by us. Business partners through whose platform you made the
						reservation and accommodation partners may choose to communicate
						with you directly via email or other channels that we do not
						control.

						With your consent, we may send you push notifications with
						information about your reservation, guest reviews, potential future
						stays, or as part of any Agoda programs that you participate in,
						including coupons. You may grant us access to your location
						information or contact details in order to provide services

						access or sign in to our Site through social media, such as Facebook
						Connect, we may collect information from you such as your username,
						and other information made available to us via such services, or –
						another example – your credit card issuer might, via Visa or

						service provider. In general, we may work with our partners to
						improve and personalize your use of our website in accordance with
						this policy. We have partnered with Facebook to provide personalized
						content on Agoda for members of Facebook. If you are a Facebook and
						Agoda user and you have signed into Agoda via the Facebook single

						the accommodation, the date of stay, the location of the
						accommodation, your review of past accommodation, the hotel room and

						your Facebook friends who are also Agoda customers and who have
						signed in through the Facebook single sign on feature on the Site,
						as displayed on their search pages described above within the Site
						and updated each time you make a booking through Agoda. How to opt
						out: Agoda has made it simple for you to opt out of this feature at
						any time by toggling no through (i) the thank you page after you
						make a booking, and (ii) your Manage My Booking page on the Site.
						Further, if you need help to opt out you may contact our customer
						experience team at any time.

						security measures to protect your information against accidental or
						unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, or unauthorized
						disclosure or access. We use Secure Socket Layer technology to
						encrypt credit card information during transit. Through your
