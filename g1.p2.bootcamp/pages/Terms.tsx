						A Word on Charges for Taxes and Fees
					</div>
					<div>
						In connection with facilitating your Accommodation transaction, the
						charge to your Payment Instrument may include a charge for taxes and
						fees (“Taxes and Fees”) unless indicated otherwise. In relation to
						Accommodations, this charge includes an estimated amount to recover
						the amount our site pays to the Accommodation in connection with
						your reservation for taxes owed by the Accommodation including,
						without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax,
						excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes. In certain
						locations, the tax amount may also include government-imposed
						service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing
						authorities but required by law to be collected by the
						Accommodation. The amount paid to the Accommodation in connection
						with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate
						and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for
						Taxes and Fees, if any, is a fee our site retains as part of the
						compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your
						reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. If the
						balance is negative, our site will absorb such difference. The
						charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors
						including, without limitation, the amount our site pays the
						Accommodation and the location of the Accommodation where you will
						be staying, and may include profit that our site retains. Our
						Accommodation suppliers, as vendors, include all applicable taxes in
						the amount billed and our site pays over such amounts directly to
						the vendors. our site is not a co-vendor associated with the vendors
						with whom we book or reserve your travel arrangements. Taxability
						and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary
						greatly by location. For transactions involving Accommodations
						located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your Payment
						Instrument for Taxes and Fees includes a payment of tax that our
						site is required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax
						owed on amounts our site retains as compensation for services. For
						reservations where you need to pay at the Accommodation, the price
						may or may not include taxes and fees. Please verify the booking
						conditions and your confirmation mail or voucher or contact our
						Customer Service team. In some locations, Accommodations may be
						required by local law to charge and collect city, bed, tourist
						occupancy or equivalent taxes directly. Taxes and fees for Ancillary
						Services you may purchase are described out in our Partner terms
						and conditions.

					</div>
					<div>

						to collect and process your information required by processing
						service providers or the financial institution that issues your
						Payment Instrument such as a credit or debit card in order to verify
						your identity. Personal information collected about you and that may

						complete payment for such pre-paid Accommodation bookings, you
						authorize our site or Related Companies to charge or debit your
						Payment Instrument for the full price upon reservation and
						confirmation of the booking or, in case of a “Book Now, Pay Later”
						booking, at the future point in time communicated in the
						confirmation email. When using “Book Now, Pay Later”, please ensure
						that your Payment Instrument is valid and has sufficient credit on
						the future payment date. If the Payment Instrument cannot be charged
						on such date for whatever reason, the booking will be cancelled
						unless you can ensure that the card payment can be authorized on
						time. Please check the reservation details thoroughly for any such
						conditions prior to making your reservation. our site or Related
						Companies will process refunds, if and when applicable, within a

						through the service which facilitates the processing of payment
						transactions. For certain Accommodations, our site will not charge
						your Payment Instrument, as you will pay the Accommodation directly
						for your stay . However, in such cases some Accommodations may
						pre-authorize your card, charge a deposit or charge the full price
						of the reservation up-front. Accommodations may require credit card
						details in order to guarantee your reservation. As such, our site
						will send your Payment Instrument information directly to the
						Accommodation at which your booking is made and may verify your
						Payment Instrument as well. In order to safeguard and encrypt your
						Payment Instrument information when in transit to us, we use the
						Secure Socket Layer  technology for our services. Please note that
						your bank may impose additional fees on the transaction. Certain
						Payment Instrument companies charge their member banks a fee for
						processing foreign transactions. If you make card transactions and
						the recipient uses a bank located in a different country other than
						the bank which issued your card, an international service
						assessment, cross-border transaction fee or similar fee may be
						charged. Your issuing bank may or may not pass this fee on to you .
						Please contact your issuing bank for details as this is outside the
						control of our site . In the event of Payment Instrument fraud or
						unauthorized use of your Payment Instrument by third parties, you
						should contact your bank or card issuer immediately upon becoming
						aware of such unauthorized use. If you suspect an unauthorized or
						fraudulent booking was made via our site, please contact our
						Customer Service team immediately. In order to make a booking you
						must be over 18 years old . You undertake that the Payment
						Instrument you are using is your own or that you are authorized to
						complete the booking with this Payment Instrument and that there are
						sufficient funds to cover the cost of the transaction. You accept
						financial responsibility for all transactions made under your name

						making a booking are fully correct. our site reserves the right not
						to accept certain Payment Instruments. our site may add or remove
						other payment methods at its discretion. For increased convenience,

						Verification Value or security code the next time you use it to make
						a booking. For more details, have a look at our Privacy Policy. We
						have stringent fraud detection and prevention mechanisms in place.
						In certain cases, we may require additional information or
						verifications to validate and confirm the booking, as explained in
						more detail on the Site. A small verification charge or
						pre-authorization may also be made to your card, also when using
						Book Now Pay Later. The balance will be charged after confirmation
						or, in case of Book Now Pay Later, on the future payment date .
						Reservations are not confirmed until you have received a
						confirmation email with a voucher and it is possible that an
						Accommodation or Ancillary Service could become fully booked during
						the fraud check, in which case the reservation will no longer be
						available. our site can never be held liable in such cases.
						Additional information submitted will be treated in line with strict
						industry standards to protect privacy, using encryption for
						transmission and specialized agents for verification. If you choose
						not to submit the additional information or if we are not satisfied
						with the information received, the booking will be cancelled because
						it is incomplete and any amounts charged will be refunded.
